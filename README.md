# Spring Boot Java and React JS Application start up

This project uses Webpack alongside a Maven to build and run.

## Available Scripts

### `mvn spring-boot:run`

This builds and runs the Spring Boot application for the back end.

[Here's how you can execute Maven goals in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build)

### `npm run-script watch`

Builds the front end bundle.js and watches for changes.
Rebuilds the front end on any change to /frontend files (.js), which allows you to view changes without restarting the Spring Boot app.

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to access the application.
